**Write the LaTeX for your integral and its solution**
```latex
\int_a^b \ln(cx) dx = x\ln(cx)-x\biggr|_{x=a}^{x=b}
```
**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the integral request here.

**Note:** _Integrals are evaluated by a simple postfix calculator, so more complicated integral solutions involving limits or otherwise non-standard evaluation techniques are not supported._
